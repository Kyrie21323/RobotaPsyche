Why would people need a robot psycgologist when the problem must be in the code of the robot? Rather than talking to them, I think it would make more sense to break down the codes to fix problems.

## 2
A robot without or with a weakened first law, to me, seems as if they are just metals existing to save Humans. (As if they were slaves). In special situations, such as a dangerous working place, would we be seeing some type of robots as slaves in the future as well? What if in some places robot exist just to save humans, and humans only? 

## 3
The way how Calvin and Bogert tests their robots is a very similar to the turing test. They are trying to distinguish which robot tries to disobey the rules/or be conscious. Just like the first test, if a robot is seen as lying (Nestor 10 in test 1) just to blend in with the others, can we call that a successive test?

## 4
Continuing, Calvin thought Nestor 10 was lying in the first test just to blend in with the others. But if all of the 63 robots acted unexpectedly in the second test, could this mean that in the first test, Nestor 10 wasn't faking himself but the test itself was not proper?

## 5
If, like in the book, robots are capable to think for themselves, will we be able to use them in any kind of work field where they are also put to danger?
