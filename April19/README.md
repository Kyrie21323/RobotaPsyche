# 3 topics for discussion (Reason by Isaac Asimov)
## 1. What if Cutie and Donovan and Powell was not in danger, would Cutie end up killing them by leaving them locked up in the officer's room?
## 2. At what point do you think Cutie was able to think that he is superior to human beings? Did he base this on his intelligence or his abilities to accomplish things?
## 3. If cutie believes that his 'master' is the power source of the chip, can we say that he is willing to obey the chip (which is a part of himself) instead of humans? And at one day he will be able to crack the code of the three laws and be able to do what ever he wants to?
