# 3 topics for discussion (Reason by Isaac Asimov)
## 1. What if Cutie and Donovan and Powell was not in danger, and he did not find his own reason to help them, would Cutie end up killing the whole human race?
## 2. At what point do you think Cutie was able to think that he is superior to human beings? Did he base this on his intelligence or his abilities to accomplish things?
## 3. If cutie believes that his 'master' is the power source of the chip, can we say that he is willing to obey the chip (which is a part of himself) instead of humans? If other robots start to think like that, would they think that the smartest among them is the master? And at one day will he be able to crack the code of the three laws and be able to do what ever he wants to?
