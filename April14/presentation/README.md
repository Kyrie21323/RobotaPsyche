Slide 1
Good evening everyone today I would like to discuss on the consciousness test (Turing test) and how we, humans can determine whether the robots, especially the AIs, are conscious or not.

Slide 2
I would like to talk about the Turing test, one of the most famous test to determine whether a machine is conscious or not.

Alan Turing is the father of computer science who developed the “Idea for the Universal Turing Machine”, which is the basis for the first computer.

Alan Turing made the Turing test in 1950 to determine whether machines are conscious, which he developed from a question “Can Machines Think?”

He named computers and robots as machines because they did not exist back then

The Turing test starts with three players where one player C, the interrogator is isolated from the two other players A and B, one of whom is human, and one of whom is a computer. The interrogator’s job is to try and figure out which is the human and which is the computer by asking questions to both. To make things harder, the computer is trying to make the interrogator guess wrongly, or in other words, it is trying to be as indistinguishable from a human as possible.

If the interrogator is unable to determine computer from human, Turing says that we can call it a thinking computer.

Slide 3
Before going deeper into the topic, let me ask you a quick question—
“Do you think the Turing test would be able to determine whether a robot is conscious? If not do you think the test at least determines if the robot can think?”

Also, through this test, if a robot seems to be conscious to us, can we consider it to be conscious?

As most of you said it is impossible for us to determine whether the robot is fully conscious or even thinking just based on this single test. Actually there has been a bunch of robots who passed this test, which will be introduced in the next slide.

Slide 4
The first program that is claimed to succeed on passing the Turing test is Eliza. Eliza was able to mislead many people by mimicking a psychologist, encouraging them to talk more, and reflecting their own questions back at them.

In the annual competition the Loebner Prize, a much formal type of the Turing test which awards to the computer programs considered by the judges to be the most human-like, many chatbots have succeeded in passing the Turing test.

The 1997’s winner Catherine showed an amazingly focused and intelligent conversation.
Another winner in 2014, Eugene Goostman, who was given the persona of a 13 year old Ukrainian boy, made the judges think that its awkward grammars and non sequiturs as language and culture barriers.

Other programs such as Cleverbot have taken a different approach by statistically analyzing huge databases of real conversations to determine the best responses. And some even store previous conversations to improve their chats over time.

These success highlighted one weakness of the test. That robots can be programmed to mimic human chats.

Slide 5
(Show the image of me talking to Eliza)
As you can see although ELIZA extremely tries to re-ask every question I ask, we can see that the conversation goes on very well. I was very annoyed by this program.

Slide 6
So the question is, given that we are unable to tell whether a robot is conscious even though it passes the Turing test, what else can we notice from the robots that did pass the Turing test?

Does this mean the Turing test is totally useless? What other consciousness test can you think of?

Let’s see a quick video of an AI robot named Sophia before moving on to my next question.

Slide 7
As you could see in the video, Sophia is able to learn very fast just by talking to someone about a new topic - and in this video it was The Netflix series black mirror.

Just like Sophia and CleverBot, a lot of AIs these days are able to learn and absorb new information and knowledge by stacking their experience just like how humans go through trial and error to succeed. Lets say all of the AI’s that exist right now are still in that learning phase.
Once AI robots master learning moral, ethic problems and many more, and say they are able to mimic people completely, could we be able to tell the difference between AIs and Humans?
And if that day comes, because they are able to mimic to be a complete persona, or in other words they appear to be conscious, will we, then, be able to call them conscious?
