# Assignment 6

## Problems
Although I do think that I have succesfully finished my assignment, I am not sure if the result of the assignment is what exactly professor has expected us to do. The non aggressive and/or non red vehicles do avoid the ones that are red and/or aggressive, but the non-aggressive/red vehicles also seem to avoid themselves. Therefore, the result of the project looks more like where vehicles all together avoid each other. Except for that part, I think I'm done.

## Hardships faced
At first, I wanted the vehicles to follow the flowfield which I wanted it to be random. However, I remembered that the random flowfield does not stay constant once it is generated - the flow at each one point of the field constantly changes which is probably because of the draw function being a loop. So this I gave up.
